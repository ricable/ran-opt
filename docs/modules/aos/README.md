let policy = NetworkPolicy::new()
    .with_rule("traffic_threshold", 0.8)
    .with_action("scale_up", ScaleUpAction::new())
    .with_priority(PolicyPriority::High);

policy_engine.add_policy(policy).await?;

// Evaluate policies against current network state
let network_state = get_current_network_state();
let policy_decisions = policy_engine.evaluate_policies(&network_state).await?;

for action in &healing_actions {
    let result = healing_engine.execute_action(action).await?;
    
    if result.success {
        println!("Action executed successfully: {}", action.description);
    } else {
